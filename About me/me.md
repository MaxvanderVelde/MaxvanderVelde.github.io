# About me
As you may have come to know, my name is Max van der Velde. I am a statistics and methodology nerd/enthusiast/teacher that is currently in his second year of the master program [Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). 

## Current activities and future endeavors 
During my final year as a student i work at the [Centraal Instituut voor Toets Ontwikkeling](https://www.cito.nl/) (CITO) as an intern, while also conducting my master thesis here. During my internship i study and apply different [Differential item functioning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-014-9408-y) methods, while my master thesis focusses on the usability of explicible machine learning models in determining text difficulty. Starting this summer, i will be looking for PHD positions that both provide the possibility to advance my research skills as well as allow me to either teach or conduct project-based work. 

## Some personal information
I am currently 25 years of age, own a dog and love teaching. Due to this i have taught courses covering statistics and methodology at the University of Utrecht for the past two years and enjoy doing so immensely. In my continuously decreasing free time i enjoy taking walks, jogging, reading books and meeting friends (at atleast 1.5 meters distance). Some things that, in my opinion, make me who i am are my love for discussions, constant enthusiasm and loyalty.
