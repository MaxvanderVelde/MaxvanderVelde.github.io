# About me
As you may have come to know, my name is Max van der Velde. I am a statistics and methodology nerd/enthusiast/teacher that is currently in his second, and final, year of the master program [Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). 

## Current activities
During my final year as a student i work at the [Centraal Instituut voor Toets Ontwikkeling](https://www.cito.nl/) as an intern, while also conducting my master thesis here. Starting this summer, i will be looking for PHD positions that provides both the possibility to advance my research skills as well as allowing me to either teach or conduct project-related work. 

## Some more personal snippets of information 
I am currently 25 years of age. In the past i have taught courses in statistics and methodology for over two years and have work as a team leader in a [supermarket](https://www.janlinders.nl/) for two and a half years, enjoying both immensely. In my continuously decreasing free time i enjoy taking walks, jogging, reading books and meeting friends (at atleast 1.5 meters distance).
